# Generalisable and Robust Deep Learning Models for Flood Prediction

The central objective of this work is to research and develop accurate, generalisable and robust flood prediction models, using data-driven and deep learning techniques.

The model will be input with information describing a particular area (such as satellite imagery and elevation values) as well as the antecedent conditions (precipitation forecasts and current soil moisture values). The model will then output inundation maps, predicting exactly which areas would be flooded as a result.
